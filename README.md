# 🚗 Car Rental System

This project is a **Car Rental System** developed using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**. It simulates a basic car rental platform where users can browse available cars, view details, and book a car using a web form. All booking data is stored in a **MySQL** database, and server-side operations are handled using **PHP**.

The system includes the following main components:

- `index.html`: Homepage
- `cars.html`: Displays available cars
- `book.html`: Booking form for users
- `style.css`: Styling for all pages
- `script.js`: Handles form validation and basic interactivity
- `php/connect.php`: Establishes connection with MySQL
- `php/insertBooking.php`: Handles form submissions and stores bookings
- `php/getCars.php`: Retrieves car listings from the database
- `db.sql`: SQL script to create necessary database tables
