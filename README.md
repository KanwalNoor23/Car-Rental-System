# 🚗 Car Rental System

This project is a **Car Rental System** developed using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**. It simulates a basic car rental platform where users can browse available cars, view details, and book a car using a web form. All booking data is stored in a **MySQL** database, and server-side operations are handled using **PHP**.
